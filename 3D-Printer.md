Hackeriet have a Prusa MK3S+ printer available for members to print. 

Get started: 

Run a slicing software, ie PrusaSlicer. 

Export STL to gcode.

Upload to printer via octoprint (hackerpass needed) via the network or load from SDCard localy in the printer.



Other info: 
We have some filament available atm. 


How to swap filament: 
Press the printerknob and choose unload filament from the menu, wait until it warms up and follow the instructions. 
Start a print and the printer will ask for new filament to be inserted before starting. Yay autodetect!
