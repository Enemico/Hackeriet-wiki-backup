h2. What is Hackeriet?

This a physical space where people can go to make things, meet others and share knowledge and technology. This is not just about computer programming; Any hackers, from ham radio people and electronics geeks to artists and metalworkers are welcome to join up. Our strength is in diversity. If you have your own project, Hackeriet can offer you support. If you are just getting started, or don't know what to learn next, Hackeriet is the place to be. If you have skills you would like to share, you can gain recognition from your peers and experience with delivery.

If you are new to the space, you should read the [[Newcomers Guide]].
