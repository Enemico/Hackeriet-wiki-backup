15Â¤h1. Fakturering

A way to automagically send invoices to members, and register payments.

Made a system to parse BBS emails from the bank and register payments,
along with a simple webUI to check on these payments and confirm new members.

Since members pre\-pay for x months, they will receive two warnings: one when there is one month left, one when there is one week left. We can discuss giving a week of grace before disconnection.

Ideally, we connect this system to the PDU so that it is fully automatic and doesn't need human intervention to operate.

h2. TODO

* What remains is using FinFaktura (https://code.google.com/p/finfaktura/) to mail out the invoices and reminders.
* We should have a buffer, so we don't have to suddenly raise the monthly fee in case a few members drops out. Perhaps we can have a party to launch the Nettlaug, where the proceeds go towards this buffer?
