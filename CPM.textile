Some software or services do not make offer the personal key\-based authentication we prefer.
Hackeriets non\-personal passwords are stored in a shared password manager.

To get access, you need:
# CPM software installed (packages for linux, source compile on mac)
# an invitation to get access from an existing password repo member, with repo url.
# a published GPG key
# send your SSH public key to the member that has invited you

Once you have all of these things, you can clone the password repo and make use of it as described in
"decentralized CPM":https://github.com/comotion/cpm/wiki/Revision\-control#using\-decentralized\-cpm.

h2. Do all hackeriet members get access to the passwords?

Access is directly linked to trust. In general, three criteria have to be filled before you can get access to the password database:

# you are a hackeriet organizer or active member
# you need several different passwords to maintain one or more services
