For the waste our members and visitors produce, we have different buckets in the space we use for rough sorting. 
These cans needs regular emptying by our members. Please bring a bag when you leave.

- Food related (Green bag)
- Plastics (Purple bag)
- Paper
- Mixed
- Recyclable glass bottles and cans (without pant)

Club Mate and other bottles and cans with pant is handled separetly by our Club Mate contact.

In Hausmania's backyard, there are larger containers where we can take out our bins. 
It's nice if we do this on a regular basis, to avoid filling the container up for the rest of the house's tenants.


For electronic waste, we've used to fill up our basement. We would like to avoid this in the future, so we rather collect a little hump of waste and wait until one or more of our members take it out to one of the waste disposal sites in the region.
