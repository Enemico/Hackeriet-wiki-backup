13Â¤h1. Construction

The strike lock needs 5V 1A open the lock, (some strike locks need 12V),
therefore we need a relay\-transistor circuit like this:

all wired with common ground.
Furthermore, the RFID reader has a led/buzzer function which we hooked directly to the relay output.

h2. Further work:

<pre>
{
  5V / strike lock signal         tx
 12V / rfid reader power          tx
 GND / common ground              tx
  D0 / rfid reader data0          rx
  D1 / rfid reader data1          rx
 LED / led indicator   (optional) tx
 BUZZ/ sound indicator (optional) tx
}
</pre>
