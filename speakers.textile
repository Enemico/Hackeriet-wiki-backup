The [[Hackeriet:]]/[[Humla:]] sound system is a 5000W PA mounted in a half\-size rack. It consists of a
* 16\-channel mixer,
* 16 channel multicable, 
* equalizer, 
* filter, 
* two amplifiers and
* some random equipment. 
* two passive subwoofers
* two tops

In addition, we have several DI boxes, and some elements for the backline.
