## Deadline: 14th of February, 2023

[@kiloreven](https://github.com/kiloreven) ordered a 3D printer from Prusa in November, and now the time has come to make up the accounts.

When the purchase was made, there was a consensus in IRC that we'd just pull the trigger, and those who wanted to contribute could do so afterwards. For my part, I'm taking a 1.5k NOK stake in the payment, and I'm hoping those who want to contribute could chip in as well.

The grand total ended up being 10 680.11 NOK:
* 8 266.11 NOK/â‚¬777.46 to Prusa
* 2 414.00 NOK to DHL (import fee + tax + handling)

Process:
* Send money by Vipps to +47 454 56 376 (Karl Fredrik Haugland) with your name and "Prusa 3DP" as comment
* Add yourself to the contributors list below (you're the ones making this possible, it should be celebrated!)
* After the 14th of February I'll make a request with the Hackeriet treasurer to expense the remainder
