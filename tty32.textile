 14:07:11          +tty32 | Anyone who cannot cope with mathematics is not fully human.  At best he
 14:07:12          +tty32 | is a tolerable subhuman who has learned to wear shoes, bathe and not
 14:07:12          +tty32 | make messes in the house.
 14:07:24         @fnords | yes :/
 14:07:38           @ln2v | math <3
 14:07:52         @fnords | i might need a maths tutor if i am to become fully human someday

lafa:
* lambda calculus
* graph/set theory

h3. excersises: 

on attendance: 
seeing as this is math lab I suggest you all find math excersises in your respectively chosen subjects
excersises need not be insanely hard, but they should be something you dont know how to do yet
hopefully if I don't know either we'll figure it out together

on progression:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_mathematics

h3. Plan

To satisfy the wishlist we must first satisfy the dependencies.

dependencies (makefile style)
