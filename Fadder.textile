60Â¤h1. Fadder

A fadder aka sponsor or mentor is a hackeriet member (or [[/Captains|captain]] ) with access to the hackerspace who has front door keys and is familiar with the space and its community, who agrees to adopt a newcomer as a prospective member and:

* bring prospect into the space
* show them around
* help them with projects (it is enough to give pointers and be a sounding wall)
* introduce prospective member to other members and prospects
* teach the routines
* help prospect hold their first talk/workshop
* lend prospect your key

If you are a newbie, consider finding one of our longer\-standing members online, on meetup, irc or the mailinglist that shares some of your interests,
and ask them to show you around.

If you are a long\-standing member, please consider bringing someone new to the space and sponsoring them.
