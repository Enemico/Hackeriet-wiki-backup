10Â¤h1. Specification

Let me try a spec:

A keycard has a creation date
when it was first seen by the system, 
and an ID identifiying the card uniquely.

Some users shall have keycards,
keycards to open locks,
locks that open doors.
Some keycards open many locks,
some locks the keycards can only open 
from a certain point in time to another.

Some locks may have special keycards,
which leave the door in a state
of always open or always locked,
or airlock mode,
which only opens one door if another
is closed.

Some special users may grant other users
access to some locks. 
Only the very special users may grant the
ability to grant users.
